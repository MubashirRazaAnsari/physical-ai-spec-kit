# Quickstart Guide: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Research Paper

## Getting Started

This guide helps you understand and contribute to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics research paper project.

### Prerequisites
- Basic programming concepts knowledge
- Git for version control
- Markdown editor or viewer

### Project Overview
This project produces a comprehensive research paper covering:
1. Introduction to Physical AI
2. Humanoid Robotics System Architecture
3. Learning Paradigms for Embodied Intelligence
4. Human–Robot Collaboration and Workforce Impact
5. Open Challenges and Future Directions

```

### Writing Guidelines
1. Maintain academic rigor while ensuring accessibility
2. Focus on conceptual depth over breadth
3. Base content on established research and recent developments
4. Follow the dependency order specified in the implementation plan
5. Address the four research questions systematically

### Review Process
- Each section must align with the specification and clarifications
- Verify content remains within defined scope
- Confirm each research question is progressively addressed
- Check for technical defensibility

### Next Steps
1. Review the implementation plan for section dependencies
2. Begin with the Introduction to Physical AI section
3. Follow the established execution order
4. Use the research summary as a reference for key concepts
