## Validation Rules from Requirements

1. All entities must be discussed without excessive mathematical detail (per FR-012)
2. Entities must be framed from AI-first perspective with embodiment awareness (per FR-013)
3. Content must remain accessible to readers without robotics experience (per FR-009)
4. Each entity must connect to at least one research question (per FR-001)

## State Transitions (if applicable)

For this research paper, state transitions refer to the conceptual evolution of understanding:
- Basic concept → Detailed explanation → Practical implications → Future considerations
