- P5: Section 5 - Open Challenges and Future Directions

## Dependencies

- Section 2 depends on Section 1 (terminology and framing)
- Section 3 depends on Sections 1 and 2 (system model)
- Section 4 depends on Sections 2 and 3 (capabilities and limitations)
- Section 5 depends on all previous sections (synthesis)

## Parallel Execution Opportunities

- Research for different sections can occur in parallel during early phases
- Review and editing of completed sections can occur while later sections are being written
- Reference collection and citation formatting can happen throughout the process
