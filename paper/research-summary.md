# Research Summary for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Paper

## 1. Physical AI vs Software-based AI

### Key Distinctions
- **Embodiment**: Physical AI systems exist in and interact with the real physical world, while software-based AI operates in virtual/digital environments
- **Real-time Constraints**: Physical AI must operate under real-time constraints with physical safety considerations
- **Sensorimotor Integration**: Physical AI integrates perception and action in continuous loops with the environment
- **Environmental Constraints**: Physical AI must account for real-world physics, safety, and wear

## 2. Humanoid Robotics System Architecture

### Core Components
- **Perception Systems**: Vision, audition, touch, proprioception, and exteroception
