# Terminology and Framing for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Research Paper

## Core Terminology

### Physical AI Systems
- **Definition**: Embodied artificial intelligence systems that interact with the physical world through sensors and actuators
- **Key characteristics**: Real-world interaction, sensorimotor integration, environmental constraints

### Software-based AI Systems
- **Definition**: Traditional AI systems that operate in virtual/digital environments without physical embodiment
- **Key characteristics**: Virtual environments, no physical constraints, simulation-based operation

### Embodied Intelligence
- **Definition**: Intelligence that emerges from the interaction between an agent and its physical environment
- **Key characteristics**: Environmental coupling, sensorimotor contingencies, morphological computation

### Humanoid Robotics
- **Definition**: Robots designed with human-like form and capabilities for interaction and task performance
- **Key characteristics**: Anthropomorphic design, human-compatible interfaces, biologically-inspired movement

## Conceptual Framework

### Distinction Axes
1. **Embodiment**: Physical AI has real-world presence vs. software AI's virtual existence
2. **Interaction**: Physical AI engages with physical environment vs. software AI's data processing
3. **Constraints**: Physical AI faces real-world limitations vs. software AI's computational focus
4. **Safety**: Physical AI requires physical safety considerations vs. software AI's data security focus

### Integration Model
- Physical AI systems integrate perception, control, learning, and actuation in real-time physical interaction
- This differs from software AI which typically processes data in discrete computational steps

## Research Questions Framework
1. How does Physical AI differ from software-based AI? (Focus on embodiment and real-world interaction)
2. How do perception, control, learning, and actuation integrate? (Focus on system architecture)
3. Which learning paradigms are most relevant? (Focus on embodied learning approaches)
4. What are the workforce implications? (Focus on systems and policy level impacts)
