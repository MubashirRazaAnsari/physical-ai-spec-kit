## Prompt

$ARGUMENTS

## Response snapshot

Successfully integrated comprehensive clarifications into the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Research Paper specification. The clarifications addressed key areas including:

1. Audience focus: Academic/Research focus with rigorous theoretical foundations
2. Approach to depth vs breadth: Prioritizing conceptual depth over exhaustive coverage
3. Theory vs application balance: Primarily conceptual and systems-oriented approach
4. Robotics vs AI emphasis: AI-first approach with embodiment awareness
5. Learning paradigms scope: Paradigm-level discussion without algorithmic deep dives
6. Academic vs industry orientation: Academically structured but grounded in real-world systems
7. Ethical and societal discussion: Systems and policy level perspective
8. Reader expectations: Following structured arguments and system diagrams
9. Non-goals: No tutorials, benchmarking, or proprietary system descriptions

These clarifications were integrated into the specification document by:
- Adding a "Clarifications" section with the session details
- Updating functional requirements to reflect the clarified constraints
- Modifying success criteria to align with the clarified objectives
- Enhancing edge cases to address the new considerations

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: All major ambiguities resolved in the specification
- 🧪 Tests: null
- 📁 Files: specs/001-physical-ai-paper/spec.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.plan to proceed with implementation planning
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification now has clear direction on key architectural and content decisions
